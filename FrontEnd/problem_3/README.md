1.Inefficient Sorting Algorithm:
 . The sortedBalances array is computed using the useMemo hook. However, the sorting algorithm used is inefficient.
 . The current sorting approach compares priorities for each pair of balances, resulting in multiple comparisons for the same blockchain.
 . A more efficient approach would be to sort the balances directly based on their priority values without repeatedly comparing them.

2.Unused Variable:
 . The variable formattedBalances is computed but never used within the component.
 . This unnecessary computation can be removed to improve performance.

3.Undefined Variable:
 . In the getPriority function, lhsPriority is referenced, but it is not defined anywhere.
 . It should be replaced with balancePriority.

4.Missing Dependency in useMemo:
 . The useMemo hook depends on balances and prices, but it doesnâ€™t include them in its dependency array.
 . To ensure proper re-computation, add [balances, prices] as the second argument to useMemo.

5.Lack of Type Safety:
 . The blockchain parameter in the getPriority function is of type any.
 . Consider using a more specific type (e.g., an enum or a union type) to improve type safety.

6.Unused Props:
 . The WalletPage component receives props (children and rest), but they are not used.
 . If these props are unnecessary, consider removing them.
